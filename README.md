Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction Project Plan
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict used car prices and deploy it as an interactive Streamlit web application. The solution will help both customers and sales representatives at Car Dheko to get accurate price estimates quickly.

Project Phases
1. Data Collection and Preparation
Data Acquisition: Download datasets from CarDekho for multiple cities

Data Integration:

Import all city datasets (likely in Excel format)

Add 'City' column to each dataset

Concatenate into a single structured dataset

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values (imputation for numerical, mode/new category for categorical)

Standardize formats (remove units from strings, convert to proper data types)

Detect and handle outliers using IQR/Z-score methods

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate central tendencies and dispersion metrics

Visual Analysis:

Distribution plots for numerical features

Count plots for categorical features

Scatter plots for price vs. key features

Correlation heatmap

Feature Analysis:

Identify most predictive features

Analyze feature importance

Detect multicollinearity

3. Feature Engineering
Encoding:

One-hot encoding for nominal categorical variables

Label/ordinal encoding for ordinal variables

Scaling: Apply Min-Max or Standard scaling for numerical features

Feature Creation:

Calculate car age from year

Create meaningful feature combinations

Consider dimensionality reduction if needed

4. Model Development
Train-Test Split: 80-20 or 70-30 split with stratification

Model Selection:

Linear Regression (baseline)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

Stacking/Ensemble methods

Cross-Validation: k-fold CV for robust evaluation

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV

5. Model Evaluation
Metrics:

Primary: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Secondary: MSE, RMSE, RÂ²

Diagnostics:

Residual analysis

Error distribution

Feature importance plots

Model Comparison: Select best performing model based on metrics

6. Deployment
Streamlit App Development:

User input forms for car features

Real-time prediction display

Explanatory visualizations

User-friendly interface

Deployment Options:

Streamlit Sharing

AWS/GCP cloud deployment

Docker containerization
